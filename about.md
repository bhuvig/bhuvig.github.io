I am a Third Year Undergraduate in the Department of Electrical Engineering, IIT Kanpur. I am a technology enthusiast. My current interests lie in Robotics, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Cyber Security. Don't ask me what I want to do with my life, I don't know yet!


### More Information
I like to try new stuff besides exploring more of what I already know. You can find my academic career summed up [here](http://home.iitk.ac.in/~bhuvig/resume.pdf).

I hope you must have noticed that I have a blog too! I have always wanted to read how the world of communication came into being. So, as and when I find time to look up something, I follow it up with a blog post. Just summarising all that I understood or found facinating. Do go give it a glance(or don't?)! And don't forget to give me feedback!
